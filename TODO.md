# Combat System
-Combat is turn based

-Health is measured in pints of blood left. If players is cut, they lose a certain amount of blood across a length of time depending on severity. After x amount of time, the bleeding stops, and blood starts regenerating. Regenerates faster if food is eaten

-There is a chance for a critical hit to sever a limb. If one arm is gone, you cannot wield two handed sword, and you lose a lot more blood. Only issue is what happens if you lose one/both your legs? What consequences could that have, besides more bleeding?

-We should keep track of enemy damage the same we keep track of player damage

-There should always be a way to kill an enemy without engaging in combat. For example, if a troll is in a cave with loose rocks on the ceiiling ,the player should be able to drop the rocks on the troll

-Enemies are a ROP, meaning they block pathways between locations

# Plot
-Told in 3rd person omniscient, past

-Fantasy world

-Player stole from wizard and the wizard teleported him to the top of the mountain

-Intro text is from player's POV, making it seem to be that he is not in the wrong

-Player thinks they are 'good' at first, but realize over time that they committed crimes

-Themes of good vs evil and appearance vs reality
