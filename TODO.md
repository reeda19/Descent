# To Do (Short Term)
- [ ] Have a reliable way to print existence of enemies/items at a location
- [ ] Write character descriptions
- [ ] Plan out plot
- [x] Finish implementing player movement
- [x] Define Item superclass, weapon sublclass, and armor subclass
- [ ] Have a working model of an enemy
- [ ] How to keep track of player damage?
  
  -->If a limb is crippled, it cannot be used
   
  --> How else can we track damage?
- [ ] Armor decreases damage/chance of crit
- [ ] Define base player damage/chance to injure
- [ ] Having a working model of Rite of Passage


# To Do (Long Term)
- [ ] Narration is in 3rd person
- [ ] Check/save points
- [ ] Compass-->Check map feat?-->JSON?
- [ ] Realistic gore (ability to cut off limbs, have consequences, etc.)
- [ ] Combat system --> turn based, random chance for crit hit based on weapon
- [ ] Leaderboard based on time for game completion
- [ ] Background music (simple, 8 bit)
- [ ] Fight or flee from enemies, but cannot move forward
- [ ] Always a way to kill enemy, even without weapons (use environment)


# Ideas for keeping track of damage
-Liters of blood left. If players is cut, they lose a certain amount of blood across a length of time depending on severity. After x amount of time, the bleeding stops, and blood starts regenerating. Regenerates faster if food is eaten

-Limbs, of course. If one arm is gone, you cannot wield two handed sword, and you lose a lot more blood. Only issue is what happens if you lose one/both your legs? What consequences could that have, besides more bleeding?

-Possibility of infection for cuts?

-We should keep track of enemy damage the same we keep track of player damage
